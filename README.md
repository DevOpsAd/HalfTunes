iOS Unit Testing and UI Testing

This iOS Unit Testing and UI Testing tutorial shows how to use Xcode’s test navigator to test an app’s model and asynchronous methods, how to fake interactions with library or system objects by using stubs and mocks, how to test UI and performance, and how to use the code coverage tool. Along the way, you’ll pick up some of the vocabulary used by testing ninjas, and by the end of this tutorial you’ll be injecting dependencies into your System Under Test (SUT) with aplomb!
